# Roadmap #

## Issues ##

Packages to be fixed:
- openssl 1.1.0 breaks lynx, wpa\_supplicant, snownews builds
- flex does not cross compile (see issue #78)

I should also run namcap on the remaining packages, and fix any warnings...

Otherwise, grep for TODO's in the PKGBUILDs.


## Packages ##

Remaining packages:

- fbpdf
- linux-toshiba


## Misc ##

- Working on the Toshiba (v0.3.0)
- Update the Toshiba kernel config (v0.3.1)
- All remaining packages built (v0.3.2)
- Mirror set up (v0.4.0)
- Website published (v0.4.0)
- Being able to build all the Arch Linux packages (maybe?)
- Shrink memory usage for the kernel and userspace
