# Roadmap #

## Issues ##

Packages to be fixed:
- busybox man requires nroff
- openssl 1.1.0 breaks lynx, wpa\_supplicant, snownews builds
- flex does not cross compile (see issue #78)

I should also run namcap on the remaining packages, and fix any warnings...

Otherwise, grep for TODO's in the PKGBUILDs.


## Packages ##

Remaining packages that I can think of:

- tex (pdflatex, at least)
- qemu
- unison
- netsurf
- ca-certs
- fbpdf


## Misc ##

- Release system working (live CD)
- Mirror set up
- Website published
- Xorg up and running
- All remaining packages built
- Working on the Toshiba (v0.3.0)
- Being able to build all the Arch Linux packages (maybe?)
- Improve the documentation
- Update the Toshiba kernel config
- Shrink memory usage for the kernel and userspace
