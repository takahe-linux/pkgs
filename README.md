# Overview #

Takahe Linux is my experimental Linux distro, dedicated to 'extinct' computers.

It is supposed to be a learning experience for me, and an opportunity to play
around with some different software.


# Status #

Currently, there is nothing to see. Literally. Apart from this document.

I'll hopefully have a stab at adding some initial packages during the 2014-2015
holiday break.

I've managed to build a working system before, both using LFS, and loosely
based on [Sabotage Linux](https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage
"Sabotage Linux (Github)").
So, in theory, this is something I am quite capable of doing.
But I haven't had any success with building a cross-compile toolchain. Which
does suggest further troubles...


# Takahe #

The Takahe is a flightless New Zealand bird, which was thought to be extinct.
However, it was rediscovered in 1948...

For more information, see [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Takahe "Takahe (Wikipedia)").


# Naming scheme #

Following on from the idea that Takahe Linux is helping extinct birds (in this
case, older computers) fly again, I plan to name releases after extinct NZ
birds.

Wikipedia (again) has [an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/List_of_extinct_animals_of_New_Zealand#Birds "Extinct NZ birds (Wikipedia)")
listing them.


# Who am I? #

I am myself!

Who else :)

More seriously, I am not a distro maintainer, developer, or any other such
title. Experimenter, really. Keep that in mind if you decide to try this distro!
