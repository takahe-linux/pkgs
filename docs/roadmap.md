# Roadmap #

## Issues ##

Packages to be fixed:
- openssl 1.1.0 breaks lynx, wpa\_supplicant, snownews builds
- netsurf has some relatively easy fixes

I should also run namcap on the remaining packages, and fix any warnings...

Otherwise, grep for TODO's in the PKGBUILDs.


## Packages ##

Packages to consider adding:

- nldev
- pass
- x11 and related (dwm, st, dmenu, xorg utils, xclip, ...)?

Fixes/changes:

- Make hush the default shell
- Make the OOM killer more aggressive?


## Misc ##

- All remaining packages built (v0.3.2)
- Mirror set up (v0.4.0)
- Website published (v0.4.0)
- Being able to build all the Arch Linux packages (maybe?)
- Shrink memory usage for the kernel and userspace
