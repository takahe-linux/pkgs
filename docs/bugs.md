# Known bugs #

These are known bugs with Takahe Linux.

- Epoch's config is stuffed.
- I need more documentation...
- The automatic script could do with being polished - firing up the completed
  image in qemu if it was a qemu machine would be good.
- No machine specific default configs...

# Kind-of bugs #

- Takahe Linux still uses too much memory.
- I need to add more packages...
