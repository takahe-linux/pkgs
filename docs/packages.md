# Packages that I intend to build #

I would like all of the below; however, I also to intend to have 100 packages
or less. So...

- file
- gcc-based toolchain
- ssh
- web browser (lynx? netsurf?)
- go
- vim
- tex (pdflatex, at least)
- fbv
- qemu
- python3
- bash
- pacman
- git
- unison
- patch

This list is very incomplete!
